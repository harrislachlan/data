## Arber et al., 2020
The directory [scripts/](scripts/) contains 3 R scripts corresponding to the upcoming publication **Familial Alzheimerâ€™s disease mutations in PSEN1 lead to premature human stem cell neurogenesis**. 

The scripts analyse a published dataset of scRNA-seq from [Hochgerner and colleague (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0056-2) from the mouse hippocampus by examining the expression of AD genes along the adult hippocampal neurogenic lineage.

The count matrix can be accessed from the **Gene Expression Omnibus** [GSE95315](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95315) by downloading the GSE95315_10X_expression_data_v2.tab.gz file. 

Data shared by [Charlie Arber](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h9X1WlAAAAAJ&hl=en), Senior Research Fellow, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK.
